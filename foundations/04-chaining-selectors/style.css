/* Add CSS Styling */

/* 
The properties you need to add to each element are:

* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `proportioned`
classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it
retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in
a pixel value for the height!).

* Make the element with both the `avatar` and `distorted`
classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big
as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).

## Desired Outcome
![desired outcome](./desired-outcome.png)

### Self Check
- Did you properly chain class selectors for each rule?
- Does the `proportioned` image retain its original square
proportions?
- Does the `distorted` image end up looking squished and,
well, distorted?
